DE.AE (Adverse Event Analysis),"Anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse events are analyzed to characterize the events and detect cybersecurity incidents",High,"N1: Adverse event analysis involves studying the data on potentially adverse events collected by continuous monitoring to find possible attacks and compromises and declaring when an incident has occurred so as to initiate incident response activities. <br> R1: The volume of potentially adverse events to be analyzed is generally quite high, so organizations should rely on technical solutions that filter large event datasets down to a subset that is suitable for human viewing and analysis. <br> N2: The fidelity of events varies based on many factors. Anomalies may have benign or malicious foundations. Some incidents are relatively easy to find amid the noise, while others require deep, specialized technical knowledge and experience. <br> N3: CTI can be invaluable in detecting malicious activity early, reducing its impact, and shortening recovery time. Signs of an incident may be more obvious later in the attack life cycle, but the incident's impact and scope may be much larger. <br> R2: Organizations should strive to find incidents earlier in the attack life cycle and take a proactive approach to incident detection and response."

RS.MA (Incident Management),Responses to detected cybersecurity incidents are managed,High,"N1: Incident management involves overseeing responses to all incidents and shifting priorities and resources as needed. Evaluating the overall risk from an incident and applying the appropriate prioritization are perhaps the most critical decision points in the incident response process. <br> R1: Because of resource limitations, incidents should not be handled on a first-come, first-served basis. <br> R2: Incident triage, prioritization, escalation, and elevation and decisions regarding when to initiate recovery processes should all be based on a set of risk evaluation factors. This set can range from simple to incredibly complex, depending on the needs and maturity of an organization. <br> N2: Examples of possible risk evaluation factors include asset criticality, functional impact of the incident, data impact of the incident, stage of observed activity, threat actor characterization, and recoverability. <br> R3: The incident response status should be tracked for each incident along with pertinent information, such as an incident summary, indicators of compromise related to the incident, the status and expected time frame for each assigned action, and next steps to be taken."
RS.MA-01,The incident response plan is executed in coordination with relevant third parties once an incident is declared,High,"R1: Detection technologies should automatically report incidents that they have confirmed. <br> C1: Consider designating an incident lead for each incident. <br> R2: If appropriate, contact the organization's incident response service provider to request assistance. <br> R3: Initiate execution of other cybersecurity plans as needed (e.g., business continuity and disaster recovery plans) to support incident response."

Reports should be carefully monitored and taken seriously. For example, the organization might be contacted by a party claiming that its systems are being attacked by a system at the organization. External users may report other indicators, such as an unavailable service. Other incident response teams may also report incidents to the organization."
RS.MA-03,Incidents are categorized and prioritized,High,"R1: Perform a more detailed review of incidents to help categorize them by incident type (e.g., data breach, ransomware, account takeover, denial of service). <br> R2: Prioritize how quickly incident response should be performed for each incident based on its scope, likely impact, time-critical nature, and resource availability. <br> R3: Select incident response strategies for active incidents by balancing the need to quickly recover from an incident with the need to observe the attacker or conduct a more thorough investigation. <br> N1: Every response strategy decision has trade-offs. For example, a strategy that supports observing the attacker's behavior or conducting a more thorough investigation may be at odds with the need to quickly return to normal operations."
RS.MA-04,Incidents are escalated or elevated as needed,High,"N1: Escalation generally refers to increasing resources or time frames, while elevation usually indicates involving a higher level of management in the response efforts. <br> R1: Track and validate the status of all ongoing incidents so that incidents in need of more response resources or a change in response strategy can be identified and the necessary changes initiated rapidly."
RS.MA-05,The criteria for initiating incident recovery are applied,High,R1: Apply incident recovery criteria to known and assumed characteristics of the incident to determine when an incident's recovery processes should be initiated. <br> R2: Take the possible operational disruption of incident recovery activities into account to determine when recovery should be initiated.

RS.AN-03,Analysis is performed to establish what has taken place during an incident and the root cause of the incident,High,"R1: Determine the sequence of events that have occurred during the incident and which assets and resources were involved in each of those events. <br> R2: Attempt to determine what vulnerabilities, threats, and threat actors were directly or indirectly involved in the incident. <br> R3: Analyze the incident to find the underlying or systemic root causes. <br> R4: Check any deployed cyber deception technology for additional information on attacker behavior. <br> N1: This information may also be helpful for identifying weaknesses in cybersecurity risk management that should be addressed to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future."
RS.AN-06,"Actions performed during an investigation are recorded, and the records' integrity and provenance are preserved",High,"N1: Facts discovered and actions taken during incident response tasks can be recorded by many means, including a paper logbook, audio/video recordings, or automatic session monitoring and logging, as permitted by the organization's incident response plan and policy. <br> R1: Safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of incident response records, and ensure that only authorized personnel have access. <br> N2: Incident response records can contain sensitive information, such as data on exploited vulnerabilities, recent data breaches, and users who may have performed inappropriate actions. The incident lead is often responsible for ensuring that incident response records are properly safeguarded."
RS.AN-07,"Incident data and metadata are collected, and their integrity and provenance are preserved",High,"N1: Many incident responses involve the collection of incident data and metadata. Formal evidence gathering and handling using chain-of-custody procedures might not be performed for every incident that occurs (e.g., most malware incidents will not result in prosecution). However, collected incident data is still considered evidence, which is defined as ""grounds for belief or disbelief; data on which to base proof or to establish truth or falsehood"" [SP800-160v1]. <br> R1: Collect and retain evidence from an incident in accordance with the organization's evidence preservation procedures and data retention policies, and consider factors such as the possibility of prosecution, and the cost of retaining the data and the hardware and software needed to access the data in the future."
RS.AN-08,An incident's magnitude is estimated and validated,High,"N1: Determining the incident's magnitude is often one of the most challenging aspects of incident response. <br> R1: Look for indicators of compromise, evidence of persistence, and other signs of an incident on both the assets known to be targeted and other potential targets. Skipping this activity or performing it in a superficial way may cause underestimation of the incident's magnitude, thus allowing the incident to continue indefinitely on other targets without the organization's knowledge or monitoring."
RS.CO (Incident Response Reporting and Communication),"Response activities are coordinated with internal and external stakeholders, as required by laws, regulations, or policies",High,"N1: Incident response reporting and communication activities tend to fall into four categories. Incident coordination involves communicating current and planned incident response activities for a particular incident among the internal and external parties with incident response roles and responsibilities. Incident notification involves formally informing affected customers, employees, partners, regulators, or others about a data breach or other incident. Public communication involves communicating to the public about the status of a particular incident, such as responding to media inquiries. Incident information sharing involves sharing cybersecurity threat information with others, usually voluntarily, based on activity observed within the organization's technology assets. <br> R1: Organizations should have mechanisms in place in advance to coordinate with affected parties about incidents when needed."
RS.CO-02,Internal and external stakeholders are notified of incidents,High,"R1: When an incident is analyzed and prioritized, the incident response team should coordinate with the appropriate individuals inside and outside of the organization so that all who need to be involved will play their roles. <br> R2: Follow established procedures concerning incident coordination that include what must be reported to whom and at what times (e.g., initial notification, regular status updates). <br> R3: Perform notifications in compliance with the current incident notification-related laws and regulations that pertain to the organization's sectors, geographic locations, customer locations, and any other characteristics that apply to the organization. Incident notification is an evolving topic, and new laws and regulations are being established frequently. <br> R4: Notify affected third parties of data breaches and other cybersecurity incidents in accordance with regulatory, legal, and contractual requirements. <br> R5: Notify law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies of incidents based on criteria in the incident response plan and management approval. Designated individuals should contact these parties in a manner consistent with the requirements of the law and the organization's policies and procedures."
RS.CO-03,Information is shared with designated internal and external stakeholders,High,"N1: Voluntary incident information sharing is often mutually beneficial because the same threats and attacks simultaneously affect multiple organizations. An example is sharing information about observed TTPs with a sector-specific Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC). <br> N2: Sharing defensive tactics between organizations can enhance overall situational awareness and increase the resiliency of all. There is a cost to threat actors to develop or purchase exploits and to deploy them. The effective identification and dissemination of detection techniques lowers the attackers' return on investment and increases their costs. <br> N3: Incident handlers might coordinate their efforts with colleagues at partner organizations to share tactical, technical information on mitigating an attack that spans those organizations. The organizations participating in this type of relationship are usually peers without authority over each other. In addition to choosing to share information, they may also pool resources to solve common problems. <br> R1: Securely share information with stakeholders consistent with the organization's response plans and information sharing agreements, including contracts with suppliers. <br> R2: Regularly update senior leadership on the status of major incidents. <br> R3: Notify human resources when malicious insider activity has occurred. <br> R4: Establish and follow media communications procedures for incident response that comply with the organization's policies on media interaction and information disclosure."
RS.MI (Incident Mitigation),Activities are performed to prevent expansion of an event and mitigate its effects,High,"N1: Manually selecting containment and eradication actions may be easier and faster if the organization has criteria and procedures in place. Criteria could take the incident type into account (e.g., a cloud-based services compromise or a user endpoint ransomware infection) and use some of the risk evaluation factors in RS.MA. Another factor to consider is the duration of the containment measure (e.g., an emergency workaround that must be removed within hours, a temporary workaround to be removed within two weeks, or a permanent solution). The eradication measure's duration could be similarly evaluated. <br> R1: In some instances, organizations redirect an attacker to a sandbox so that they can monitor the attacker's activity, usually to gather additional evidence. This delays containment and eradication activities. The incident response team should first discuss the feasibility of this strategy with the legal department before executing it. The intentional delay can be dangerous because an attacker could escalate unauthorized access or compromise other systems."
RS.MI-01,Incidents are contained,High,"N1: Containment refers to preventing the expansion of an incident. Containment can prevent additional damage and avoid overwhelming the organization's resources. Most incidents require some form of containment. <br> C1: Consider configuring cybersecurity technologies (e.g., antivirus software) and the cybersecurity features of other technologies (e.g., operating systems, network infrastructure devices) to automatically perform some containment actions, like quarantining malware, transferring a compromised endpoint to an isolated remediation network, or halting the execution of an infected container. <br> C2: Consider authorizing third parties (e.g., the organization's internet service providers and cloud service providers) to automatically act to contain certain types of incidents (e.g., large-scale DDoS attacks) on behalf of the organization. <br> R1: Allow incident handlers to manually select and perform containment actions instead of or in addition to automated containment measures."
RS.MI-02,Incidents are eradicated,High,"N1: Eradication refers to mitigating an incident's effects. After containment, eradication may be necessary to eliminate persistence mechanisms and entry points, such as deleting malware, disabling breached user accounts, and identifying and mitigating all exploited vulnerabilities. <br> R1: Identify all affected hosts and services within the organization so that all flaws and weaknesses can be remediated. <br> C1: Consider configuring cybersecurity technologies and the cybersecurity features of other technologies (e.g., operating systems, network infrastructure devices) to automatically perform some eradication actions. <br> C2: Consider authorizing third parties (e.g., the organization's internet service providers and cloud service providers) to automatically act to eradicate certain types of incidents on behalf of the organization. <br> R2: Allow incident handlers to manually select and perform eradication actions instead of or in addition to automated eradication measures."
RC (Recover),Assets and operations affected by a cybersecurity incident are restored,High,"N1: During incident recovery, personnel restore systems to normal operations, confirm that the systems are functioning normally, and (if applicable) remediate vulnerabilities to prevent similar incidents. <br> N2: Recovery operations include restoring systems from clean backups, rebuilding systems, replacing compromised files with clean versions, installing patches, changing passwords, and tightening security controls. In intrusions where the threat actor is highly sophisticated and the full scope of their tactics is not revealed, it may be necessary to go as far as replacing the hardware (e.g., bare metal) of all of the compromised systems. <br> N3: For more information on incident recovery, see [SP800-184]."
RC.RP (Incident Recovery Plan Execution),Restoration activities are performed to ensure operational availability of systems and services affected by cybersecurity incidents,High,"N1: Executing the incident recovery plan involves selecting, prioritizing, and performing recovery actions in a secure manner; verifying the integrity of recovered assets; declaring the end of incident recovery; and completing incident documentation. <br> N2: For more information on incident recovery plans and plan execution, see [SP800-184]."
RC.RP-01,The recovery portion of the incident response plan is executed once initiated from the incident response process,High,R1: Begin recovery procedures during or after incident response processes. <br> R2: Inform all individuals with recovery responsibilities about the plans for recovery and the authorizations required to implement each aspect of the plans.
RC.RP-02,"Recovery actions are selected, scoped, prioritized, and performed",High,"R1: Recovery actions should take timeliness, precision, and reliability (e.g., restoring only the affected files versus restoring all files) into account. <br> R2: Select recovery actions based on the criteria defined in the incident response plan and available resources. <br> R3: Change planned recovery actions based on a reassessment of organizational needs and resources."
RC.RP-03,The integrity of backups and other restoration assets is verified before using them for restoration,High,"R1: Check restoration assets for indicators of compromise, file corruption, and other integrity issues before use."
RC.RP-04,Critical mission functions and cybersecurity risk management are considered to establish post-incident operational norms,High,R1: Validate that essential services are restored in the appropriate order. <br> R2: Work with system owners to confirm the successful restoration of systems and the return to normal operations. <br> R3: Monitor the performance of restored systems to verify the adequacy of the restoration.
RC.RP-05,"The integrity of restored assets is verified, systems and services are restored, and normal operating status is confirmed",High,"R1: Check restored assets for indicators of compromise, and remediate the root causes of the incident before production use. <br> R2: Verify the correctness and adequacy of the restoration actions taken before putting a restored system online."
RC.RP-06,"The end of incident recovery is declared based on criteria, and incident-related documentation is completed",High,"R1: Prepare an after-action report that documents the incident itself, the response and recovery actions taken, and lessons learned."
RC.CO (Incident Recovery Communication),Restoration activities are coordinated with internal and external parties,High,N1: Incident recovery communication is a continuation of the communication activities in RS.CO.
RC.CO-03,Recovery activities and progress in restoring operational capabilities are communicated to designated internal and external stakeholders,High,"R1: Securely share recovery information, including restoration progress, consistent with response plans and information sharing agreements. <br> R2: Regularly update senior leadership on recovery status and restoration progress for major incidents. <br> R3: Follow the rules and protocols defined in contracts for incident information sharing between the organization and its suppliers. <br> R4: Coordinate crisis communication between the organization and its critical suppliers."
RC.CO-04,Public updates on incident recovery are shared using approved methods and messaging,High,R1: Follow the organization's breach notification procedures for recovering from a data breach incident. <br> R2: Explain the steps being taken to recover from the incident and to prevent a recurrence.
